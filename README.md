If you read the notebook, you can refer to [Our Machine Learning Google Colab](/StonksTheBestSavingAccount.ipynb "Our codes on ipynb") that we have done numerous steps to achieve the end result including data collection.

# Machine Learning On Stocks

Created as a group project for CZ/CE1115 in order to answer one of the biggest questions on everyone's mind: 

**Is Stocks and Cryptocurrency the best Savings Account?**

In order to learn more about the stock markets with machine learning, we decided to try out 2 ways of to predict the stock market:
- Polynomial Regression Line
- Multivariate Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) Model

## First, how much can we earn on Savings Account?
We take a look at how much we can earn by extrapolating **10000 USD** over 10 days based on an annual interest rate of 0.05% according to POSB savings account. The result isn't that astonishing.

So we are going to explore what if we put them into stocks or cryptocurrency.
